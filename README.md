This is a simple repository to keep track of my coursework for the Coursera class, [Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course3/index.php), which is Part II of a series of courses on Java offered by Duke and UC San Diego.  The coursework for the first course can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ZalmanKelber/Java-Coursework).

These programs can be run using the BlueJ IDE found [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

Documentation for the classes used in the duke.edu library used in this course, such as FileResource and DirectoryResource can be found [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/).

Completed thus far:

* CaesarCipher and CaesarCipherTwo

* ObjectOrientedCaesarCipher
